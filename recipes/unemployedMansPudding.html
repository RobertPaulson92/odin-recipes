            Pouding chômeur (unemployed man's pudding)
            is a dessert that was created during the early years of the Great Depression in Quebec, Canada.
        </p>
        <p>
            The pouding chômeur is a basic cake batter onto which a hot syrup or caramel is poured before baking.
            The cake then rises through the liquid which settles at the bottom of the pan, mixing with the batter 
            and creating a distinct layer at the bottom of the dish. The syrup or caramel can be made from brown sugar,
            white sugar, maple syrup or a combination of these. During the worst of the Depression, stale bread was used 
            in lieu of cake batter.
