                A ‘hot chicken sandwich’ or simply ‘Hot Chicken‘ is one of those forgotten top 10 traditional
                dishes from Canada. It’s not spicy at all, in contrary to the famous Nashville hot chicken.
                It’s mostly popular in the French-speaking part of Canada. As a kid, I used to love it when
                my mom would do a whole roasted chicken for dinner, not because I loved the dish but because
                    I knew I would get my favourite meal the next day!

                A popular dish from the Eastern part of Canada, the famous hot chicken sandwich consists of shredded
                leftovers of chicken or turkey served with an homemade gravy and sweet peas.
