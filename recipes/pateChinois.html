        <p>
            Pâté chinois (pronounced [pɑte ʃinwa]) ('Chinese pie') is a French Canadian dish similar
             to the English shepherd's pie or French hachis Parmentier. It is a traditional recipe in both Québécois
              cuisine and Acadian cuisine.

        <p>
            The dish is made with layered ground beef (sometimes mixed with sautéed diced onions) on the bottom, canned corn
             (either whole-kernel, creamed, or a mixture) for the middle layer, and mashed potatoes on top. Seasonings may be 
             added to the top. Variations may include reversing the layering of ingredients with potatoes at the bottom, then meat,
              topped with creamed corn; adding diced bell peppers to the ground beef; and serving the dish with pickled eggs or beets.
               Once served, ketchup can be added.
